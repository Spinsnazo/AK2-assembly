# AK2-assembly
This repository consists of solutions to the tasks that I had to solve during the Computer Architecture 2 lab classes. They are done using GNU Assembler. Each assignment within the repository has a makefile dedicated to it.

## Lab 0
Create programs hello, writeText, compareText.

## Lab 1
Write two programs to perform addition and subtraction on large numbers that exceed the width of a single machine word (in this case, 32 bits).

## Lab 2
Floating Point Unit. Generate specific special values (NaN, +/-inf, +/-0). Manipulate the bits of the FPU control word.
